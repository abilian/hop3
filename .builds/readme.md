# Build profiles for Sourcehut builds

By default, all the builds are against the "latest" version of the dependencies ("stable" for Debian).

For Ubuntu (and maybe others in the future), additionally, we support the latest LTS version. (NB: this is currently irrelevant, as the LTS is also the latest release.)

See https://builds.sr.ht/~sfermigier for the latest build statuses.

TODO: fix all builds.
