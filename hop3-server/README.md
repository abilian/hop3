# hop3-server

This subproject provides (or will provide) API endpoints for the hop3 CLI (implemented in the `hop3-cli` subproject).

It currently uses the `RPyC` RPC framework, which is a robust and easy-to-use way to expose Python objects and functions over a network. This may be replaced with a more standard REST API in the future, or by something ad-hoc.
