# Hop3 Contribution Guidelines

If you're readning this, this means that you're interested in contributing to Hop3, and this alone makes us happy! Your contributions will help make Hop3 a better platform and strengthen the open source community around it.

To ensure a smooth collaboration process for everyone involved, we've established some guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

Before you start, it's important to familiarize yourself with Hop3's core values and objectives. Please take a moment to read the [core values of Hop3](../README.md#core-values) outlined in our README. Understanding these principles will help you make meaningful contributions that align with the project's goals.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Open an Issue

If you've identified a bug, have a feature suggestion, or have any question, start by opening an issue. Describe the bug, feature, or question in detail, providing as much context as possible. This helps us understand your concern or proposal and address it effectively.

### 2. Fork and Clone the Repository

Once you're ready to work on an issue, fork the Hop3 repository to your GitHub account and clone it to your local development environment. This will allow you to work on the code changes on your machine.

### 3. Create a New Branch

For each set of changes, create a new branch in your forked repository. Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the changes you intend to make.

### Guidelines for Contributions

- **Small and Focused Pull Requests (PRs)**: Please ensure your PRs are focused on a single issue or feature request. Avoid including unrelated changes, as this makes it harder to review and merge your contributions.

- **Code Style**: Follow the project's coding style. For Python code, we adhere to PEP8 guidelines, except where explicitly stated otherwise. When importing functions, prefer to import them directly (e.g., `from os.path import abspath`) rather than importing the entire module.

- **Write Meaningful Commit Messages**: Your commit messages should clearly describe what changes have been made and why. This helps maintainers understand the purpose of your changes and speeds up the review process.

- **Update Documentation**: If your changes require updates to the documentation, include those in your PR. Accurate and up-to-date documentation is crucial for users and contributors.

- **Testing**: Include tests for your changes to ensure that the new code works as expected and does not break existing functionality. Add new tests if you're introducing new features or fixing bugs.

- **Review Process**: After submitting your PR, one of the project maintainers will review your changes. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make adjustments to your code. The review process is a collaborative effort, and constructive dialogue is welcome.

### 4. Submitting Your Pull Request

Once you've completed your changes, pushed them to your fork, and ensured they align with the contribution guidelines, you're ready to submit a pull request to the main Hop3 repository. In your PR, provide a clear description of the changes and reference any related issues.

## Community and Conduct

Hop3 is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming community. We expect all contributors to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which outlines our expectations for behavior within our community. Respect, collaboration, and constructive communication are key to our community's health and success.

## Questions and Support

If you have any questions or need help with your contributions, don't hesitate to reach out to the Hop3 community. You can open an issue for questions related to contributing or seek help on our community forums or chat channels.

Thank you for contributing to Hop3! Your efforts will help make Hop3 stronger and more successful.
