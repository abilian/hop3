# Hop3 Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-17

## Introduction

Your privacy is a core value of the Hop3 project. Our commitment to user sovereignty, security, and transparency extends to the way we handle data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we protect it.

This policy applies to the services we operate to support the Hop3 project, including our websites, community forums, and code repositories. It also clarifies what data the Hop3 software itself does—and does not—collect.

## 1. The Hop3 Software (Self-Hosted)

**The Hop3 software, when installed and run on your own infrastructure ("self-hosted"), does not collect or transmit any personal data to us.**

You maintain full control over your server, your data, and your applications. The design of Hop3 is centered on this principle of data sovereignty. Any data collection or analytics (e.g., for your own deployed applications) is your own responsibility to configure and manage.

## 2. Information We Collect Through Our Project Services

To manage and promote the Hop3 open-source project, we operate several public-facing services. We collect a limited amount of information through these channels:

#### a) Website Visitors

When you visit our official websites (such as `hop3.cloud` and its documentation pages), we may collect non-personally-identifying information to better understand how our site is used.

-   **Analytics:** We use a self-hosted instance of Matomo, a privacy-respecting analytics platform. The `README.md` file includes a Matomo tracking pixel to gather anonymous usage statistics. This helps us gauge interest and improve the project. We collect:
    -   Anonymized IP addresses (the last octets are removed).
    -   Browser type and version.
    -   Pages visited and the time spent on them.
    -   Referring site.
-   **Cookies:** We may use cookies for the essential operation of our websites, such as session management. We do not use third-party tracking or advertising cookies.

#### b) Community and Contributor Information

When you interact with the Hop3 community, you may provide information as part of your participation.

-   **Code Repositories (GitHub, SourceHut):** When you contribute code, open an issue, or comment, your username and any information in your public profile are visible. Your name and email address will be embedded in Git commit data, which is a permanent and public part of the project's history.
-   **Community Forums & Chat (Matrix):** To participate, you will need an account, which includes a username and may be associated with an email address. Your posts, comments, and IP address may be logged by the service to prevent abuse.
-   **Mailing Lists:** If you subscribe to a mailing list, we will have your email address to send you updates.

#### c) Direct Communications

If you contact us directly via email (e.g., for support or to report a Code of Conduct violation), we will have your email address and any other information you choose to provide. Reports made to the Code of Conduct contact (`sf@abilian.com`) are treated with strict confidentiality.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

-   **To Operate and Improve the Project:** Analytics data helps us understand what features are popular and how to improve our documentation and websites.
-   **To Foster a Community:** We use your information to manage your account on our community platforms, attribute contributions, and facilitate collaboration.
-   **To Communicate With You:** We use your contact information to respond to your inquiries, send project updates (if you subscribe), and enforce our policies.
-   **To Ensure Security:** We may use information like IP addresses to protect our services from spam, abuse, and other security threats.

## 4. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We only share it in the following limited circumstances:

-   **With Service Providers:** We may use third-party services (e.g., hosting providers) to operate our websites and community platforms. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and only use it to provide services to us.
-   **For Legal Compliance:** We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Hop3 project, our community, or the public.
-   **As Part of Public Contributions:** Information that is part of a public contribution (e.g., your name and email in a git commit) is publicly available by design.
-   **With Your Consent:** We may share your information with your explicit consent.

## 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no online service is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain personal information for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, to operate the project, and to comply with our legal obligations. Contribution data, such as git commits, is considered a permanent part of the project's public record.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including the right to:

-   Access the personal information we hold about you.
-   Request correction of inaccurate data.
-   Request erasure of your personal information.
-   Object to the processing of your data.

To exercise these rights, please contact us at `dpo@abilian.com`. Please note that we may be unable to delete information that is essential to the public record of the project, such as git commit history.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete it.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of the policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
