# ADR: Data Encryption and Protection in Hop3

**Status**: Draft

## Context and Goals

Data protection is a critical aspect of securing the Hop3 platform. The goal is to ensure that all data handled by Hop3 is protected through robust encryption methods, both at rest and in transit. This will help protect sensitive information, comply with regulatory requirements, and build user trust.

## Decision

Hop3 will implement comprehensive data encryption strategies to protect data at rest and in transit. This includes using industry-standard encryption algorithms and ensuring that all sensitive data is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Key Components

### Data Encryption

1. **Encryption at Rest**:
   - **Database Encryption**: Encrypt all sensitive data stored in databases using strong encryption algorithms.
   - **File System Encryption**: Ensure that files and backups are encrypted on disk.

2. **Encryption in Transit**:
   - **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: Use TLS to encrypt data transmitted over networks to protect against interception and eavesdropping.
   - **Secure Communication Protocols**: Implement secure communication protocols for API interactions and data exchanges.

### Key Management

1. **Key Storage**:
   - **Secure Key Management**: Use secure key management solutions to store and manage encryption keys.
   - **Access Control**: Restrict access to encryption keys to authorized personnel only.

2. **Key Rotation**:
   - **Regular Key Rotation**: Implement a policy for regular rotation of encryption keys to limit the exposure of compromised keys.
   - **Automated Key Management**: Use automated tools to manage key rotation and ensure compliance with security policies.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Data Protection**: Ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for data protection and encryption.
- **User Trust**: Enhances user trust by demonstrating a commitment to data security.

### Drawbacks

- **Performance Overhead**: Encryption and decryption processes may introduce performance overhead.
- **Complexity**: Managing encryption keys and ensuring proper implementation can add complexity.

## Risks

- **Key Management Failures**: Risks associated with improper key management. Mitigation involves using secure key management solutions and regular audits.
- **Encryption Performance**: Potential performance impact due to encryption. Mitigation includes optimizing encryption processes and using efficient algorithms.

## Action Items

1. **Implement Encryption**:
   - Apply encryption to all sensitive data at rest and in transit.
   - Ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices.

2. **Enhance Key Management**:
   - Use secure key management solutions and enforce strict access controls.
   - Implement regular key rotation policies.

3. **Documentation and Training**:
   - Provide documentation on encryption practices and key management.
   - Train personnel on data protection and encryption protocols.
