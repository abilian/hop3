# ADR: Using Nix as an Isolation Mechanism for Applications Hosted by Hop3

**Status**: Draft

## Context and Goals

To enhance the security, reliability, and reproducibility of the Hop3 platform, it is crucial to provide a robust isolation mechanism for the applications it hosts. Traditional containerization tools like Docker offer isolation, but they can introduce complexity and potential security vulnerabilities. Nix, with its purely functional package management approach, offers a unique solution for isolation by ensuring that builds are reproducible and environments are consistent.

The goal is to leverage Nix as an isolation mechanism to provide deterministic builds, minimize dependency conflicts, and enhance security by isolating applications in a controlled environment.

## Decision

Hop3 will use Nix as the primary isolation mechanism for the applications it hosts. This involves configuring each application to use Nix for dependency management and build processes, ensuring that each application's environment is isolated and reproducible.

## Key Components

### Nix-based Isolation

1. **Deterministic Builds**:
   - **Reproducibility**: Ensure that builds are deterministic by using Nix to manage dependencies and build processes. This guarantees that the same source inputs will always produce the same outputs.
   - **Isolation**: Use Nix to isolate applications from each other by creating separate build environments, preventing dependency conflicts and ensuring consistent behavior across deployments.

2. **Security**:
   - **Controlled Environment**: By using Nix, applications are built and run in a controlled environment, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities associated with shared libraries and dependencies.
   - **Minimal Attack Surface**: Nix's approach to package management minimizes the attack surface by ensuring that only the necessary dependencies are included in the build environment.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Configuration**:
   - **Nix Packages**: Create Nix expressions for each application to define their build and runtime environments.
   - **Environment Management**: Use Nix to manage the build and runtime environments, ensuring that each application has access to the necessary dependencies without interference from other applications.

2. **Isolation Mechanisms**:
   - **Nix Shells**: Utilize Nix shells to create isolated development and runtime environments for each application.
   - **Nix Builds**: Use Nix builds to produce reproducible and isolated builds, ensuring consistency across different environments and deployments.

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Feedback Loop**:
   - **User Feedback**: Establish a feedback loop with users and developers to continuously improve the isolation mechanisms based on real-world usage and feedback.
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance and security of the isolated environments to identify and address any issues promptly.

2. **Community Engagement**:
   - **Nix Community**: Engage with the Nix community to stay updated with best practices and improvements in Nix-based isolation techniques.
   - **Hop3 Community**: Encourage contributions from the Hop3 community to refine and enhance the Nix-based isolation mechanisms.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Reproducibility**: Ensures that applications are built and run in consistent environments, reducing bugs and unexpected behavior.
- **Security**: Enhances security by isolating applications in controlled environments and minimizing the attack surface.
- **Dependency Management**: Prevents dependency conflicts by managing each application's dependencies separately.

### Drawbacks

- **Learning Curve**: Developers and users may need to familiarize themselves with Nix and its approach to package management and isolation.
- **Implementation Effort**: Requires significant effort to configure and maintain Nix expressions for each application.

## Risks

- **Complexity**: The complexity of managing isolated environments using Nix may introduce challenges. Mitigation involves thorough documentation and community support.
- **Adoption Resistance**: Some users may resist adopting Nix due to the learning curve. Mitigation includes providing comprehensive tutorials and support.

## Action Items

1. **Configure Applications**:
   - Create Nix expressions for each application to define their build and runtime environments.
   - Ensure that applications are isolated using Nix shells and builds.

2. **Enhance Security**:
   - Implement security measures to protect the isolated environments.
   - Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

3. **Engage with Communities**:
   - Engage with the Nix and Hop3 communities for feedback and contributions.
   - Provide documentation and support to help users and developers adopt Nix-based isolation.

4. **Monitor and Improve**:
   - Continuously monitor the performance and security of the isolated environments.
   - Implement improvements based on feedback and monitoring results.
