# ADR: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Hop3

**Status**: Draft

## Context and Goals

To enhance the security of user accounts and prevent unauthorized access, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) will be implemented for the Hop3 platform. MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to the platform, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.

## Decision

Hop3 will implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure user accounts. This will involve integrating MFA mechanisms, such as one-time passwords (OTP), hardware tokens, and biometric verification, to ensure that access to the platform is highly secure.

## Key Components

### MFA Implementation

1. **One-Time Passwords (OTP)**:
   - **Time-based OTP (TOTP)**: Integrate TOTP as a second factor, generated via authenticator apps.
   - **SMS OTP**: Provide the option for users to receive OTP via SMS for additional flexibility.

2. **Hardware Tokens**:
   - **U2F and FIDO2**: Support Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) and FIDO2 hardware tokens for strong, phishing-resistant authentication.

3. **Biometric Verification**:
   - **Biometric Authentication**: Integrate biometric verification methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, for platforms that support these features.

### User Experience

1. **User Enrollment**:
   - **MFA Enrollment Process**: Implement a seamless enrollment process for users to set up MFA on their accounts.
   - **Backup Codes**: Provide backup codes for users to access their accounts in case their primary MFA method is unavailable.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - **Multiple MFA Options**: Offer multiple MFA options to cater to different user preferences and capabilities.
   - **MFA Management**: Allow users to manage their MFA settings and preferences from their account settings.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Provides an additional layer of security to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
- **User Confidence**: Increases user confidence in the platform's security measures.
- **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements for strong authentication mechanisms.

### Drawbacks

- **User Convenience**: May introduce inconvenience for users who prefer simpler login processes.
- **Implementation Complexity**: Integrating and managing multiple MFA methods can be complex.

## Risks

- **Adoption Resistance**: Some users may resist adopting MFA due to perceived inconvenience. Mitigation involves providing clear instructions and support.
- **Technical Issues**: Potential technical issues with MFA implementation. Mitigation includes thorough testing and support.

## Action Items

1. **Integrate MFA**:
   - Implement OTP, hardware token, and biometric verification options for MFA.
   - Ensure seamless user enrollment and management of MFA settings.

2. **User Education**:
   - Provide clear instructions and support for users to set up and use MFA.
   - Communicate the benefits and importance of MFA for account security.

3. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the reliability and usability of MFA.
   - Continuously optimize the MFA process based on user feedback and performance metrics.
