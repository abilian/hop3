Architectural Decision Records (or ADR) are documents that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

Here is the template for an ADR. It is based on the template from Michael Nygard's book, but with some modifications. Each ADR should be in its own file, named with a number and short slug, like `001-record-architecture-decisions.md`.

Related ADRs should be clustered together. ADR id numbers are not consecutive.

The outline below is intended to be a guide. It is not necessary to follow it exactly, but it should be close. Additional section may be added as needed.
