# ADR: Development of Nix Builders for Existing Packages

## Status

Draft (v0.1)

## Context & Goals

To further enhance Hop3's capabilities and ensure compatibility with a wide range of applications, developing Nix builders for existing packages is essential. This approach will streamline the integration and management of applications within the Hop3 platform, leveraging the extensive repository of packages available in nixpkgs.

Developing Nix builders for existing packages will enhance Hop3's compatibility and ease of use, allowing a broader range of applications to be seamlessly integrated and managed within the platform. This approach aligns with Hop3's goals of providing a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly deployment process.

## Decision

Hop3 will develop a builder plugin that supports applications available in the nixpkgs repository or with Nix build configurations. This builder will facilitate seamless integration, updates, and management of these applications within the Hop3 framework.

## Key Components

1. **Builder Plugin Development**:
   - **Compatibility**: Ensure the builder plugin supports applications in the nixpkgs repository.
   - **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate these applications within the Hop3 platform.

2. **Streamlined Updates**:
   - **Automated Updates**: Implement mechanisms for automated updates of Nix-built applications within Hop3.
   - **Dependency Management**: Leverage Nix's dependency management features to ensure reliable updates.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Increased Compatibility**: Broader support for existing applications.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified integration and management of applications.
- **Automated Updates**: Reduced maintenance overhead for application updates.

### Drawbacks

- **Initial Development Effort**: Requires significant development effort to create and maintain the builder plugin.

## Risks

- **Complexity**: High complexity in ensuring compatibility with a wide range of applications. Mitigation involves thorough testing and community feedback.
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance required to keep the builder plugin up to date with changes in the nixpkgs repository. Mitigation includes establishing a maintenance schedule and community contributions.

## Action Items

1. **Development**:
   - Develop the builder plugin for Hop3.
   - Ensure compatibility with a wide range of applications in the nixpkgs repository.

2. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure reliability and performance.
   - Continuously optimize the builder plugin based on feedback and testing results.

3. **Documentation and Community Engagement**:
   - Provide comprehensive documentation for the builder plugin.
   - Engage with the Nix and Hop3 communities for feedback and contributions.
