# ADR: Nix Integration with Hop3

## Status

Status: Draft (v0.1)

## Context

The Hop3 platform aims to simplify the deployment, management, and security of web applications through a unified, self-hosted platform. To achieve deterministic, reproducible deployments and system configurations, integrating Nix as a core component is essential. Nix offers a declarative package management system and build environment, which ensures consistency and reliability across various deployment scenarios.

Integrating Nix into Hop3 will bridge the gap between deterministic, reproducible builds and the practical needs of deploying distributed applications. This project will leverage Nix's strengths to create a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly deployment process, aligning with the goals of the Hop3 platform and the NGI initiative.

## Decision

Hop3 will integrate Nix to leverage its strengths in package management and build reproducibility. This integration will involve developing Nix packages for Hop3, creating Nix builders for existing packages, and optimizing the build processes for performance and resource efficiency.

## Key Components

1. **Nix Package for Hop3**:
   - **Development**: Create a Nix package for Hop3, enabling easy installation and management within the Nix environment.
   - **Distribution**: Ensure the Nix package is ready for distribution and supports diverse Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

2. **Nix Builders for Existing Packages**:
   - **Compatibility**: Develop a builder plugin for Hop3 that supports applications available in the nixpkgs repository or with Nix build configurations.
   - **Streamlining Updates**: Ensure seamless integration and updates within the Hop3 framework by leveraging existing Nix packages as dependencies.

3. **Nix Alternatives to Native Builders**:
   - **Uniform Build Environment**: Create Nix-based alternatives to native build systems (e.g., pip, make, maven, npm) to facilitate a uniform build process using Nixâ€™s features for build isolation and environment reproducibility.
   - **Leverage Existing Projects**: Study and potentially leverage existing projects like dream2nix, pip2nix, or nixpacks to aid in this process.

4. **Optimization**:
   - **Performance**: Continuously optimize Nix expressions and build processes to enhance performance and reduce resource consumption (CPU, storage, and network).

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Deterministic Deployments**: Ensures consistent and reliable application deployments.
- **Reproducibility**: Guarantees that the same source inputs always produce the same outputs, crucial for debugging and collaboration.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized build processes and resource usage.
- **Enhanced Security**: Simplified dependency management reduces the attack surface.

### Drawbacks

- **Integration Complexity**: High complexity in integrating diverse applications with Nix.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires users and developers to become familiar with Nix and its ecosystem.

## Risks

- **Integration Complexity**: High probability and impact due to the complexity of integrating diverse applications with Nix. Mitigation involves early engagement with the Nix community and allocating buffer time for unexpected challenges.
- **Dependency Management**: Medium probability and impact. Some dependencies may not be readily available in the Nix ecosystem. Mitigation includes prioritizing applications with existing Nix-supported dependencies and working on packaging missing dependencies concurrently.

## Action Items

1. **Development**:
   - Develop the initial Nix package for Hop3.
   - Create Nix builders for existing packages in the nixpkgs repository.

2. **Optimization**:
   - Continuously optimize Nix expressions and build processes.
   - Implement Nix-based alternatives to native build systems.

3. **Community Engagement**:
   - Engage with the Nix community for support and collaboration.
   - Provide documentation and tutorials to help users and developers adopt Nix.
