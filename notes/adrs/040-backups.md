# ADR: Backup Strategy for Hop3

**Status**: Draft

## Context and Goals

Ensuring the availability and integrity of data is critical for the Hop3 platform. A robust backup strategy is essential to protect against data loss, corruption, and ensure quick recovery in case of failures. The goal is to define a comprehensive backup strategy that covers different types of data (e.g., configuration files, application data, and databases) and ensures that backups are performed regularly, stored securely, and can be restored efficiently.

## Decision

Hop3 will implement a comprehensive backup strategy that includes regular backups of critical data, secure storage of backup files, and efficient restoration procedures. This strategy will encompass application data, configuration files, and databases.

## Key Components

### Backup Types and Frequency

1. **Configuration Files**:
   - **Frequency**: Daily backups of configuration files such as `hop3.toml` and other relevant configurations.
   - **Retention**: Retain daily backups for 30 days and monthly backups for 12 months.

2. **Application Data**:
   - **Frequency**: Incremental backups daily and full backups weekly for application data.
   - **Retention**: Retain daily incremental backups for 30 days and weekly full backups for 6 months.

3. **Databases**:
   - **Frequency**: Daily backups of databases with transaction log backups every hour.
   - **Retention**: Retain daily backups for 30 days and monthly backups for 12 months.

### Backup Storage and Security

1. **Storage Locations**:
   - **Local Storage**: Store backups locally on a dedicated backup server or storage device.
   - **Remote Storage**: Use remote storage solutions such as cloud storage providers (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for redundancy and disaster recovery.

2. **Security Measures**:
   - **Encryption**: Encrypt all backup files at rest and in transit to ensure data confidentiality.
   - **Access Control**: Implement strict access control measures to restrict access to backup files to authorized personnel only.

### Restoration Procedures

1. **Regular Testing**:
   - **Test Restorations**: Perform regular test restorations to ensure that backup files are not corrupted and can be restored successfully.
   - **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of the restoration procedures and update it regularly.

2. **Automated Restoration**:
   - **Automation Tools**: Use automated tools and scripts to facilitate quick and efficient restoration of backups.
   - **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring systems to detect and alert on backup failures or issues.

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Feedback Loop**:
   - **User Feedback**: Establish a feedback loop with users and administrators to continuously improve the backup strategy based on real-world usage and feedback.
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance and reliability of the backup processes to identify and address any issues promptly.

2. **Community Engagement**:
   - **Hop3 Community**: Encourage contributions from the Hop3 community to refine and enhance the backup strategy.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Data Protection**: Ensures the availability and integrity of critical data.
- **Quick Recovery**: Facilitates quick recovery in case of data loss or corruption.
- **Security**: Enhances security through encryption and strict access control measures.

### Drawbacks

- **Resource Intensive**: Requires significant storage resources and network bandwidth for regular backups.
- **Management Complexity**: Adds complexity to system management, requiring careful planning and monitoring.

## Risks

- **Backup Failures**: Potential risk of backup failures or corruption. Mitigation involves regular testing and monitoring.
- **Security Breaches**: Risk of unauthorized access to backup files. Mitigation includes strong encryption and access control measures.

## Action Items

1. **Implement Backup Procedures**:
   - Establish regular backup schedules for configuration files, application data, and databases.
   - Ensure backups are stored securely both locally and remotely.

2. **Enhance Security**:
   - Implement encryption and access control measures for all backup files.
   - Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

3. **Test and Monitor**:
   - Perform regular test restorations to ensure the integrity and reliability of backups.
   - Monitor backup processes and address any issues promptly.

4. **Engage with Community**:
   - Encourage contributions and feedback from the Hop3 community to continuously improve the backup strategy.
   - Provide documentation and support to help users and administrators implement the backup strategy effectively.
