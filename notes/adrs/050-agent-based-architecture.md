# ADR: Distributed, Agent-Based Architecture for Hop3

**Status**: Draft

## Context and Goals

The Hop3 platform aims to deploy and manage web applications in a scalable, reliable, and efficient manner. A distributed, agent-based architecture offers significant advantages in terms of scalability, fault tolerance, and decentralization. By leveraging the theory of promises, invented by Mark Burgess, this architecture can ensure robust and predictable behavior in a distributed system. The goal is to design and implement a distributed, agent-based architecture for Hop3 that enhances its ability to manage large-scale deployments efficiently and reliably.

## Decision

Hop3 will adopt a distributed, agent-based architecture where multiple agents, deployed across various nodes, manage the deployment and operation of web applications. This architecture will utilize the principles of the theory of promises to ensure consistent and reliable behavior across the distributed system.

## Key Components

### Agent-Based Architecture

1. **Agents**:
   - **Deployment**: Deploy agents on each node in the network to handle local tasks such as application deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.
   - **Autonomy**: Each agent operates autonomously, making local decisions based on its configuration and state while coordinating with other agents as needed.

2. **Coordination**:
   - **Promised-Based Coordination**: Utilize the theory of promises to coordinate actions between agents. Agents make promises about their behavior and state changes, which other agents can depend on.
   - **Decentralized Control**: Avoid a single point of failure by ensuring that control is decentralized. Each agent can independently verify and enforce the promises made by other agents.

### Theory of Promises

1. **Promises**:
   - **Definition**: A promise is a declaration made by an agent about its future behavior or state. Promises are used to manage expectations and dependencies between agents.
   - **Types of Promises**: Different types of promises include state promises (e.g., "I promise to maintain a running state") and action promises (e.g., "I promise to deploy an application").

2. **Promise Management**:
   - **Creation and Verification**: Agents create promises based on their current state and capabilities. Promises are verified by other agents to ensure compliance.
   - **Conflict Resolution**: Mechanisms are in place to resolve conflicts when promises cannot be fulfilled, ensuring system stability and consistency.

### Scalability and Fault Tolerance

1. **Scalability**:
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Easily scale the system horizontally by adding more agents. Each agent manages a portion of the overall workload, distributing the load evenly.
   - **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing strategies to ensure that no single agent is overwhelmed, improving overall system performance.

2. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - **Redundancy**: Deploy multiple agents to handle critical tasks, ensuring that the system can tolerate the failure of individual agents without significant impact.
   - **Self-Healing**: Agents detect and recover from failures autonomously, making the system more resilient to faults and disruptions.

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Feedback Loop**:
   - **User Feedback**: Establish a feedback loop with users and administrators to continuously improve the agent-based architecture based on real-world usage and feedback.
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance and reliability of the agents to identify and address any issues promptly.

2. **Community Engagement**:
   - **Hop3 Community**: Encourage contributions from the Hop3 community to refine and enhance the distributed, agent-based architecture.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Scalability**: Enhances the ability to manage large-scale deployments by distributing tasks across multiple agents.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Improves system resilience by ensuring that failures in individual agents do not affect the overall system.
- **Decentralization**: Avoids single points of failure and bottlenecks by distributing control across multiple agents.

### Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Increases the complexity of the system by introducing multiple autonomous agents and coordination mechanisms.
- **Overhead**: Adds overhead for managing and verifying promises, as well as coordinating actions between agents.

## Risks

- **Coordination Challenges**: Potential challenges in coordinating actions between agents. Mitigation involves robust implementation of the theory of promises and thorough testing.
- **Adoption Resistance**: Some users and developers may resist the shift to a more complex, distributed architecture. Mitigation includes providing comprehensive documentation and support.

## Action Items

1. **Implement Agent-Based Architecture**:
   - Deploy agents across nodes and implement promised-based coordination.
   - Ensure agents can autonomously manage local tasks while coordinating with other agents.

2. **Enhance Scalability and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Implement load balancing and redundancy strategies.
   - Ensure agents can detect and recover from failures autonomously.

3. **Engage with Community**:
   - Encourage contributions and feedback from the Hop3 community to continuously improve the architecture.
   - Provide documentation and support to help users and developers adopt the new architecture.

4. **Monitor and Improve**:
   - Continuously monitor the performance and reliability of the agents.
   - Implement improvements based on feedback and monitoring results.
